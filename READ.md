# menu_service

The goal of this project is to expand on the Avanzare project
by creating a web service for any restaurant to utilize.


# Notes
- the goal is to provide a service to restaurants to handle online orders
- there are too many restaurant apps, and it is hard to keep track of them all
- one app for all 
    - easier on customers b/c the software is all the same(they do not have to memorize knew software all the time)
    - companies do not have to handle software and can be left to professionals 
    - potentially off delivery service
    - maybe have plans one that includes delivery?? and that would cost more
    - dine in option
- you can search restaurants by the food they offer
